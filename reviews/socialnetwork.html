		<h2>THE SOCIAL NETWORK MENTALLY EXHAUSTS</h2>
		<p>by Michael Simon</p>

		<p>Strongest Aspect: If you’ve got a movie directed by David Fincher, you’re in damn good shape. If you’ve got a movie written by Aaron Sorkin, you’re in damn good shape. If you’ve got both, a stellar cast, and a great story to tell, you’re all but unstoppable. This movie is just so intellectually stimulating. It takes the brilliant logistics of the situation and blends in with the murky waters of morality which ultimately leads to a film that leaves you feeling several things. Exhausted is one. Intrigued is another. Depressed is the main one. The pacing is fantastically well done, constantly spring-boarding between two timelines and moving at a rocket fire pace to create the urge of intensity that this movie pulls off all too well. It really creates a vibe of “blink and you’ll miss it”. Eisenberg and Garfield do incredibly well with every aspect of their respective characters, and the supporting cast holds their own and then some. My favorite thing though has to be the loaded script. So many unforgettable lines are dispersed throughout the film which make for some of my favorite scenes. The highlight comes from the segment "Do I have your full attention?"</p>

		<p class="clearfix">Weakest Aspect: There were a handful of times when I feel the movie just got too melodramatic. There were times when it just was not warranted. They were few and far between, but when they did happen, they were glaring. The best way to describe these moments is like an episode of “Full House” when the moral of the story (episode) comes out of Bob Saget’s mouth and the sappy music starts playing in the background, and you’re just left thinking “that was really kind of weird”.</p>
