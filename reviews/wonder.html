		<h2>ARE YOU READY TO MEET AUGGIE PULLMAN?</h2>
		<p>by Michael Simon</p>

		<p>At first glance, one might think that they have seen this movie before. The film about the kid that’s different in some way shape or form and their journey to learn and grow in the real world, outside of their comfort zone, with everything turning out alright in the end is a rather old archetype. However, where one might expect a movie like this to falter and succumb to obnoxious stereotypes or clichés, Wonder manages to maneuver through them with elegance and grace. What Wonder manages to do is truly astounding, because in telling this particular story without relying on the usual crutches that a film of this genre would typically depend upon, it manages to become one of the best films of its kind. This is thanks mainly to the pacing of the film as well as the extreme care taken in regards to character development across the board, which is fueled by the wonderful performances from the ensemble cast.</p>
		<br>
		<p>At the center of everything is Jacob Tremblay as August (Auggie) Pullman, a young boy suffering from a lifelong battle with mandibulofacial dystosis that has left him with a badly disfigured and scarred appearance. Under a mound of prosthetics and makeup, Tremblay manages to prove once more that he is the best child actor in Hollywood today. He claimed this title in 2015’s Room, and since then, the film and television industry has exploded with young kids displaying truly breathtaking acting chops. Yet Tremblay still trumps them all, delivering a nuanced performance of raw emotion, creating a unique character that every member of the audience will be able to relate to. That is part of the beauty of Wonder, that even though it’s main character suffers from this rare illness, it still manages to create Auggie in a recognizable way; we’ve all either known an Auggie or been an Auggie at some point in our lives. Right from the get-go, you know his journey through his first year at a real school will be rough, but we’re strapped in and ready for the ride. Auggie’s heartbreak is our heartbreak, his victories are our victories. His journey is our journey.</p>

		<br>
		<p class="clearfix">And if Auggie wasn’t enough of a relatable protagonist, the movie surrounds him with complex, three-dimensional characters to help carry the film as well. This was a brilliant method for several reasons. First and foremost, it helped shift focus of the movie from Auggie to the people around him; this is no insult to Tremblay’s performance, but the fact that the movie also focused on secondary and tertiary characters provided some much-needed outside perspectives. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The star of this section of the movie is yet another fantastic up-and-coming young actor, Izabela Vidovic as Jacob’s older sister Olivia. The neglected older sibling is yet another tired trope of films like this, but once again, Wonder usurps the idea and is all the better for it. While Via cannot help but feel a bit shorted due to the abundance of attention given to Auggie, she is still a calm and understanding character with her own interests and personality. That is to say, she’s a fully fleshed out character instead of just a bother or an obstacle to the main plot. </p>
		<br>
		<p>The same can be said for Auggie’s parents, Isabel and Nate, played beautifully by Julia Roberts and Owen Wilson. The dynamic of the four Pullman’s feels very much like a real family making their way through the difficulties of Auggie’s disease, constantly pulling one another up, facing the realities of life, and depending on one another in times when that’s all they have. In all, Wonder is a truly beautiful film with a story told through emotion and relatability rather than cliché and corniness. Every way one might expect Wonder to fail, it succeeds ten-fold, painting a picture of a family and a world that any audience member will be able to connect with. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>In a way, the execution of the movie helps drive home the main point of the story; just because something might appear one way, it does not mean that that’s the only way to look at it. In the same way that Auggie is so much more than just his illness, Wonder is so much more than the typical family drama.
