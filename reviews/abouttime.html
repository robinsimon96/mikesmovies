		<h2>ABOUT TIME HITS CLOSE TO HOME</h2>
		<p>by Michael Simon</p>
		<img src="img/abouttime.png" class="col-xs-12">
		<p>Strongest Aspect: This is an extraordinary movie in that no matter what is happening in your life when you watch it, it will always hit far too close to home. It's incorrectly marketed as a love story. That's not what this is. This is a life story. The twist is that he's a time traveler who can go back to certain times in his life and change things to better suit him, but the way this evolves as the film goes on is what really gets to me. Life is not meant to be lived in retrospect; rather, it is meant to be experienced now. In the moment. Everything happening exactly as it was intended to, be it good or bad.</p>

		<p class="clearfix">The question this movie poses, and the question I find myself still unable to answer, is "if you had the ability to change the past, would you?" The obvious answer seems to be yes. Clearly we have all, myself included, said the wrong words, done the wrong things, broken the wrong relationships, or lost the wrong people. Maybe that all serves a purpose though. Maybe that's done little else than make us all who we are today. Maybe that's life leading us to exactly where we need to be at the exact moment we are meant to be there. Personally, I don't wish to be in complete control of my life. The idea is foreign and scary to me. The unpredictability, the surprise, the heartbreak, the sadness, the joy and everything in between comes because we have some sort of unspoken trust that we are headed in the direction meant for us. As shown in the movie, the burden of pressure when you come to be in complete control is more a curse than a blessing. One person simply cannot fix everything. That's not how life works, so why bother embarking on such a Sisyphean task. I could be totally wrong, but I'm only speaking for myself.</p>
		<p>Now, you might realize I've talked a lot about the essence of the film and how it applies to who I am, but not an awful lot on the film itself as its own entity. That's how you know it's worth watching.</p>
